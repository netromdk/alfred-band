# alfred-band
Lookup bands via workflow in Alfred app.

Use keyword `band` to initiate the workflow. The text input is afterwards concurrently used to search music sites/APIs, and presented in Alfred. Actioning an item will open an URL with further information in the default browser.

The workflow automatically checks for new releases. With a 7 day frequency, it will check and if an update is available, then it shows an item at the top in Alfred that will update the workflow when actioned/auto-completed.
